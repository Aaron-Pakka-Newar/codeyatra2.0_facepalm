# White Cane & Device Guidelines

## White Cane – Overview

The white cane is the primary mobility tool for visually impaired individuals.

### How It Works
- Held diagonally, swept left-to-right while walking
- Detects ground-level obstacles (steps, curbs, potholes)
- Provides physical touch-based feedback

### Pros
- Simple, reliable, no battery needed
- Low cost, globally recognized
- Immediate tactile feedback

### Limitations
- Ground-level detection only (1–1.5m range)
- Cannot detect head-level obstacles
- No early warning capability

### Key Features
- **Extended Range:** Up to 3 meters forward detection
- **Multi-Height Detection:** Ground to head level
- **Directional Feedback:** 3×3 grid (Left, Center, Right)
- **Early Warning:** Alerts before physical contact

## Positioning

> **Our device does NOT replace the white cane.**

It is a **complementary tool** that:
- Extends detection range
- Adds head-level awareness
- Provides structured directional guidance

**Together**, the white cane and our device create a safer, more informed mobility experience.
